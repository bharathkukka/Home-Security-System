## ⚙️ System Architecture

**1. Face Recognition Module**

* Captures live video or processes uploaded images.
* **MTCNN** detects and crops faces.
* **InceptionResnetV1** extracts facial embeddings.
* Embeddings are compared with a local database.
* Unknown individuals trigger an **alert**.

**2. Weapon Detection Module**

* Activated when an **Unknown** person is detected.
* Scene snapshot sent to **Google Gemini API**.
* If a weapon is found → **High-priority alert sent**.

**3. Notification Module**

* Uses **Telegram Bot** for messaging.
* Sends alerts with **event details + images**.

**4. User Interface (Streamlit)**

* **Recognize Face** – Live/video-based recognition.
* **Add New Person** – Enroll residents, workers, and relatives.
* **Logs** – View history of alerts.
